Mustard Seed Market, Mane Habit Salon, and Appalachian FC honored

BOONE, NC - The Boone Area Chamber of Commerce is pleased to announce its winners of the 2021 Watauga County Business of the Year Awards. The winners were unveiled on Thursday, January 20, 2022, during the 6th Annual High Country Economic Kickoff Event

Startup Business of the Year: Appalachian FC
It took one short walk for a Sasquatch dribbling a soccer ball, and an icon was born. This catchy social media launch of the Appalachian Football Club brought instant notoriety to the startup National Premier Soccer League soccer franchise, and millions of eyeballs focused on the High Country in the process.

The viral video of the brand rollout captured over a million unique views helping to bolster over $200k of merchandise revenue across all 50 states, over half of which was earned before the franchise played its first match.

Its first season was a success on and off the pitch. A regular season record of 4-2-4 qualified Appalachian FC for the semifinals of the NPSL Southeast Conference playoffs. The team played to an average paid attendance of 1,100 fans at Ted Mackorell Soccer Complex, all made possible thanks to a partnership between Watauga County, Appalachian State University, High Country Soccer, and the Boone Area Sports Commission. Stamping its unique signature on each home match, the Squatch Guard fan group marched through the woods from neighboring Booneshine Brewing Company and took over the center section of Ted Mack, providing the most raucous atmosphere in the league.

"We're humbled and honored by the support of amazing fans and sponsors in the High Country. Our goal was to build a legendary soccer club that everyone in the High Country could be proud to support. The response since Day One has exceeded the BIG expectations of our Chief Marketing Officer and self-appointed General Manager Bigfoot!" shared Appalachian FC Managing Partner, Michael (Hitch) Hitchcock.

Appalachian FC worked quickly to establish local partnerships, connecting with over 30 High Country businesses in its initial sponsorship rollout. The franchise teamed with Booneshine Brewing Company to create Squatchy Ale, a seasonal beer that helped bring instant awareness to the team and its neighborhood partner. Booneshine co-owners Tim Herdklotz and Carson Coatney were among over 10 local investors that helped provide stability and recognizable High Country faces to the organization in its formative season.

Appalachian FC exceeded its revenue expectations in its first year and quickly vaulted itself to one of the most successful franchises in the NPSL. Since the conclusion of the 2021 season, the team has started the sale of local ownership shares, engaging over 150 fans with the team through a unique investment option, making Appalachian FC the Green Bay Packers of the NPSL.

"While 2021 was a good year, we're excited for 2022 and our Sophomore Season. Appalachian FC has ambitious plans, on the field and in the community, to go from "good to great"; which starts with expanding our Ownership Group with passionate High Country supporters and local leaders. It has been special to see engaged fans become engaged owners. This year is a World Cup year and Appalachian FC is well positioned to help grow the World's Game in the High Country." Hitch added.
