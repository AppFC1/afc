**Boone, NC - Appalachian FC announces the addition of 3 more players for the Inaugural Season; Boone player Edras Sandoval who attended the March Open Tryout, Shawnee State University Thomas de Graauw and Old Dominion University Diego Gonzalez**

Bigfoot was in a very zen state of mind when he shared his thoughts on the new signings, “Three more ballers have been brought into the nest by Coach Parker. Let me start with a local rising star Neymar; I mean if everyone is calling you Neymar, you must be a PLAYER. Then we have a rock solid defender Diego Gonzalez who has shown his quality at a quality college program. And then we have Dutch midfielder, Thomas who brings something special to the club. Not to mention, I love the Dutch. Every since watching them in the 1994 World Cup in Washington DC where all their fans wore orange wooden shoes that sounded like tree knocks when they walked. I digress, I’m very happy with how the team is coming together.” 

**INTRODUCING YOUR APPALACHIAN FC PLAYERS [Stats and Quotes Below]**

**Diego Gonzalez**
Diego is a left footed defender who can play multiple roles in the backline and in midfield. During his U16-U19 years, featured in almost every game for VDA in the Development Academy, becoming a sought after player for many colleges in the area. After signing for ODU, Diego has featured in the Monarchs’ back line in his first year with the program.

Coach Parker quote- “Diego is a player with exceptional talent. He has ability on the ball, mixed with great desire defensively which makes him a pleasure to work with as a coach. He will give us balance on the left side of defense which will compliment the way we want to play. I’m delighted to be working with him again at this stage of his career.” 

Diego quote- "I’m excited to get started with the club and be surrounded by quality players and coaches who will help me in many aspects of my game!" 

**Thomas de Graauw**
From Amsterdam, Netherlands, Thomas de Graauw comes to App FC with a stellar background. Thomas is a standout player at Shawnee State where he started all 19 games, contributing 9 goals and 6 assists in his first season (2019). He spent most of his youth career at S.V. Hoofddorp in the 4th tier of Dutch football. He has a reputation for scoring spectacular goals, which we hope to see this season! 

Coach Parker quote- “Thomas will be an important signing for us. His quality on set pieces will give us an edge, and his creativity in the attacking half of the pitch should provide goals and opportunities for others. He is a great character and I’m looking forward to having him in the group.” 

Thomas quote- "I am excited to be a part of Appalachian FC and I am looking forward to being a part of the family. I am grateful that I have been given the opportunity to take on this adventure and I will give it my everything to achieve great things with the team this summer.” 

**Edras “Neymar” Sandoval**

Another local talent, “Neymar” as he is affectionately know in Boone, is a young forward who stood out at the club’s first tryout on March 6th. Originally from Guatemala, Neymar has been developing his game in the Liga de Futbol Belleza for Hawks United F.C. Fans should expect to see him attacking with flair and passion in his first season with 

Appalachian FC. 

Coach Parker quote- “After seeing Neymar at the first tryout, it was obvious to me and the coaching staff that we should give him this opportunity. He will add some flair to the attack and have the ability to change a game when we need a goal. I hope this will be a good platform for him to develop and grow into a top player.” 

Neymar Quote- "Feliz por ser parte del equipo y es una aportunidad que voy aprovechar pienso que cualquiera quisiera estar en un gran equipo cómo esté"
"I am happy to be a part of the team and the opportunity that I will take full advantage of. I think anyone would want to be a part of a great team like this.”
