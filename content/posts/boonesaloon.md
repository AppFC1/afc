Boone, NC - Soccer fans in the High Country know Boone Saloon for their legendary World Cup Viewing Parties, festive Premier League Viewing Parties and soon, Boone Saloon will be known as the Home to Squatchy App FC Viewing Parties when Appalachian FC is on the road.

“I love Boone, I love soccer and I love a good Pint, I don’t necessarily love people so if I’m planning to show up, it must be a huge deal.” Appalachian FC Chief Marketing Officer Bigfoot continued, “I’m so excited by this announcement that we’re partnering with Boone Saloon to host our Away Game Viewing Parties; it makes me want to do some tree knocks.”

Boone Saloon will be the home for all away game viewing parties when they show App FC games on their big screen. Appalachian FC will provide ticket and merchandise giveaways to fans in attendance. And who knows, you may have a Bigfoot sighting at Appalachian FC Viewing Parties.

“We are really stoked. All y’all know that Boone Saloon’s the premier soccer destination of the High Country. Now we’re honored to be the official Squatch Cave for all live viewings for Appalachian FC away games. Boone Saloon and Appalachian FC - where all shots are on target!” shared Boone Saloon owner Skip Sinanian

Boone Saloon and Appalachian FC will have safe and responsible Viewing Parties to include Mask Protocols and Socially Distanced Tables for fans.

Schedule will be announced in March for all home games and away game viewing parties. For more information, Season Seats and great Squatchy gear, visit www.appalachianfc.com
