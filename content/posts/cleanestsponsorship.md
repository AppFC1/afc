Boone, NC - ​Appalachian FC is excited to announce that Bubbles has joined the Squatchy Appalachian FC Sponsorship Family in what Industry Experts are calling the Cleanest Sponsorship in the History of the Soccer World.

Bubbles always live up to their Promise: “We strive to quickly and affordably give you a clean and shiny car that you can be proud of”

“I usually travel by foot but when I need to grab something quickly without the awkwardness of “posing” for photos, I drive my Honda CRV to the big city and when I do, I always make a stop at Bubbles to put a nice shine on my ride. While I always get a bad rap for being stinky, dirty, having a gawd awful smell; Bubbles takes care of that; YES, I go through the car wash with my windows open!” Appalachian FC Chief Marketing Officer Bigfoot explained with pride. “So for Bubbles to join our growing sponsorship family of locally owned businesses, that’s something I’m very proud of. It’s like I say, Support Local Business that Support Local Soccer. Thanks to Andrew and everyone at Bubbles for your support. See you soon when it’s bath time for me and my car.”

Bubbles Car Wash is a local, family owned business so when you wash at Bubbles, you are shopping local and helping the environment by conserving water. They use only the best equipment, soaps, and waxes and the most convenient state-of-the-art wash processes to ensure that you always get the best carwash for your money. Bubbles understand that your car is very important to you and will always treat you and your vehicle accordingly. Bubbles are committed to your 100% satisfaction.

Bubbles has two locations: 1157 East King Street and 2890 NC-105. You can get more information about this squatchy sponsor at washatbubbles.com
