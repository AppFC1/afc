On A Snowy Pitch in NC - America’s Squatchiest Soccer Team now has the Squatchiest coaching staff in America with the addition of Guilford College Head Coach Cory Speed as Appalachian FC Assistant Coach.

Appalachian FC Head Coach Dale Parker shared, "I am very excited to have Cory on board as we start to build the first team in club history. After speaking with Cory, it's clear that our vision is aligned and that we will work very well together. Across three NCAA divisions and within the NAIA, he has worked at some great college programs and with some top coaches, along with building a strong program at Guilford. His addition will add another layer of professionalism at Appalachian FC as we look to make a big impact in year one."

Cory Speed brings a lot of college coaching experience to Appalachian FC. Currently, Speed is the Head Coach of Guilford College where, during the 2019 season, he led the team to their highest finish in the ODAC in the last seven years. Previous to Guilford, Cory Speed has been the Assistant Coach at Virginia Tech and Roanoke College in Virginia, St Edward's University in Texas and his alma mater, Sterling College in Kansas, where he was an All-American Honorable Mention as a Goalkeeper.

"I am delighted at the opportunity to join Dale's staff for Appalachian FC's inaugural season. In our conversations, it became apparent that this would be an ideal partnership for the both of us and I am eager to begin working with him. The ownership group has a compelling vision for the club's future and there is potential to build something special in Boone under Dale's leadership."

“I told Coach Parker that we need some speed on Appalachian FC. Well, he took me literally and added Cory Speed.” Appalachian FC Chief Marketing Officer, Soccer enthusiast and wanna-be General Manager Bigfoot added. “Cory brings Appalachian FC a ton of experience, on and off the field, that will help our club realize it’s potential during a tough expansion year during challenging times.”
