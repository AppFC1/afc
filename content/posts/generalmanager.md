Most Appalachian FC fans know Mike Raymond as part of the ownership group that successfully launched Appalachian FC in November 2020. Mike is well known around the High Country as a passionate soccer fan, key leader of the Appalachian FC Ownership Group and has been known to make a Bigfoot cameo in the community; well now, you can add Appalachian FC General Manager to that list.


Chief Marketing Officer and former self-appointed General Manager Bigfoot roared his thoughts on the news, “I mean I won NPSL General Manager of the Year [App FC Note: Self awarded by Bigfoot and not awarded by NPSL] so you think Appalachian FC would have taken up the option in my contract [App FC Note: There was no option because there was no contract because Bigfoot was not GM]. That said, Mike Raymond is the right man for the job so if you don’t want the world’s most popular cryptid to do it, then you made the right decision.”


Mike Raymond is a part of the Ownership Group and has played a critical role in the launch and successful operations of Appalachian FC over the first two NPSL Seasons.


Appalachian FC Owner & co-Managing Partner Michael “Hitch” Hitchcock shared, “Appalachian FC is coming off a very successful Sophomore season, on and off the field. Our club has evolved to the point where we need a Full Time General Manager to help lead the club to the next level. While we interviewed many candidates, the right man was already a key leader in the club. Excited for Mike as this is a dream come true for the hardest working person in our Ownership Group.”


Mike played Division I college soccer at Jacksonville University where he played right wing. In the High Country, Mike has been very active in the local soccer community at the youth and adult levels. Mike is married to wife, Jamie who have four children; Emma (14), Braxton (11), Marley (9) and Briggs (3) that are all actively involved in High Country soccer.


We asked our new GM a couple of rapid-fire questions:

- Favorite soccer moment: “Beating Duke in the first round of the NCAA tournament and speaking to Jay Heaps after the game. Also, App FC winning the conference title in front of our home fans last season was up there as well!”
- Favorite Premier League Team: “Manchester United”
- Favorite Soccer Player: “Wayne Rooney”
- Prediction for US performance at 2022 World Cup: “We win the group and make a run to the finals! I BELIEVE!”


New Appalachian FC General Manager Mike Raymond shared his excitement for this opportunity, “The passion and commitment I had for soccer growing up led me to play at the collegiate level, for a D1 school. I hope to bring that same passion and commitment to this club. This is a position that I consider to be my dream job. I am excited to be a part of continuing the growth of the beautiful game here in the high country!”Jason O’Keefe, former App State Men’s Soccer Coach and current Appalachian FC Owner & co-Managing Partner added, “I am very happy for Mike, and Jamie, to get this first full time role with the club. Mike has dreamed of this day and has told me several times. Now his dream is becoming a reality because he BELIEVED!!!!The Raymond’s have been as hands on as any owner could be. The time and dedication has been instrumental for App FC’s growth and success. The club's future is very bright under the leadership of Mike in the high country.”


Appalachian FC is preparing for the clubs third season where the club is making plans to participate in the 108th Lamar Hunt US Open Cup and defending the NPSL Southeast Conference Championship.
