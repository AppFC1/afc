Appalachian FC is excited to announce that The La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Boone University, Sleep Inn Boone University Area and Super 8 by Wyndham Boone University Area are the Official Nest Partners of Bigfoot and Appalachian FC for the inaugural season. All Three Properties are owned by Panoramic Hospitality and managed by First Carolina Management out of Rocky Mount. Visiting teams to the High Country will stay at The La Quinta Inn & Suites, Sleep Inn or Super 8 while all three properties will provide special Appalachian FC Discounted Rates for Appalachian FC fans and visiting soccer fans coming to the High Country this Summer.

Appalachian FC CMO Bigfoot, doing his best Dos Equis commercial impersonation, “I don’t leave the woods for the big city very often but when I do, I stay at The La Quinta Inn & Suites. I consider it my Nest away from Nest.” The Big man added, “On behalf of our Front Office, thank you Justin Patel and the entire Panoramic Hospitality team for your support and joining our Squatchy Sponsorship Family.”

While most professional sports teams have an Official Hotel Partnership, WE BELIEVE this is the World’s first Official Nest Partnership in the history of soccer. Believers all know the commonly accepted term for Bigfoot’s Home is Nest.

Panoramic Hospitality owner Justin Patel added, “Having grown up in the High Country with Soccer being a way of life, we are very proud to be the official Nests of Appalachian FC. We will always strive our best to provide the best accommodations to Bigfoot and all of Bigfoot’s family and friends while visiting the High Country! We look forward to future sightings this summer and can’t wait to see what the season has in store.”

The La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Boone University (165 Highway, NC-105 Extension, Boone NC), Sleep Inn Boone University Area (163 Highway, NC-105 Extension, Boone NC) and Super 8 by Wyndham Boone University Area (2419 Highway 105, Boone NC) are all ideally located for visiting teams and fans.

All three hotels will have the designation of Official Nest of Appalachian FC for 2021; with joint promotions planned for the historic Inaugural Appalachian FC Season.

Additional details about special discounts and promotions will be announced soon with the 2021 Schedule announcement in Mid-February. For more information on Appalachian FC, Season Seats and Squatchy hot gear, visit ​www.appalachianfc.com
