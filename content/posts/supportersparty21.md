East Boone, NC - Appalachian FC is proud to announce a delicious partnership with Booneshine Brewing Company for the 2021 Inaugural Season. Booneshine will be creating Appalachian FC “Squatchy Ale” to celebrate soccer in the High Country. This new Booneshine brew will be available in 16oz cans and on draft in the tasting room. Great beer and great soccer are a part of the supporters culture of the beautiful game, so it’s only appropriate that Booneshine will host the Official Pre-Game Supporters Party where fans can meet, enjoy great food and Appalachian FC “Squatchy Ale” before marching down the hill to the Appalachian FC home games. Only in the High Country would the Supporters March go through the woods from Brewery to Ted Mack Soccer Stadium located in East Boone. Then after all Home Games, the entire Appalachian FC team (players, coaches, staff) will join the fans for a Post-Game Party at Booneshine to celebrate a great game.

“Appalachian FC is a community club, so bringing the entire High Country community together before, during and after the game is what we’re all about. And if we can’t do that with a great beer, then I will disappear forever.” Appalachian FC CMO Bigfoot exclaimed rather enthusiastically. 

So, to summarize, Booneshine Appalachian FC Beer (check), Pre-Game Supporters Party (check), Supporters March to the Stadium (check) and Post-Game Celebration with the entire Appalachian FC team (check). 

”Booneshine Brewing Company will serve as the perfect place for pre and post match festivities for Appalachian FC. We look forward to sharing “Squatchy Ale” with the Boone community this Spring.” shared Tim Herdklotz, owner of Booneshine Brewing Company 

2021 Appalachian FC Home Schedule has been released with the first Road Match on May 1st in Louisville and the Historic Home Opener vs Georgia Revolution on May 15th. Appalachian FC will also play an Exhibition Match on Friday, May 7th vs. Tri-Cities Otters to help kick off the King of the Mountain Soccer Tournament.
