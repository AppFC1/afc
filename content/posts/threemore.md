App FC Head Coach Dale Parker stated “As head coach it’s great to sign another group of players that have already represented this community. These guys will be so important to us as we build a solid foundation this year. Camden will hopefully bring goals, Kelvin some excitement going forward and Myson will add some steel to our defensive side of the game. Can’t wait to work with all three of them." Coach Parker shared additional thoughts about the three new signings, “Camden Holbrook - is a prolific attacking player who has already scored big goals at Ted Mac so expecting the same this summer. He is now gaining great experience at Syracuse playing in the ACC.

Kelvin Mulinya is a wide attacking player that’s personality is bigger than life. He will add to our attacking prowess but more importantly light up the high country community with his smile and appreciation for life like he did while at App State. Kelvin is currently at Maryville a DII powerhouse and Top 10 program. Myson Darden Is an athletic & versatile player that will be a big part of App FC inaugural season in most defensive positions.
