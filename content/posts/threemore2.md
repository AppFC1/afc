Head Coach Dale Parker added - “Kevin is an experienced player who will guide others and be a role model for some of our younger guys. His ability on the ball and desire to

work hard is infectious, and this was evident for the duration of tryout last week. We are lucky to have a player of his calibre, who is a local guy and knows what this club means to the local soccer fans.” 


Kevin shared his thoughts- “I have been living in Boone for over 12 years, so being a part of Appalachian FC is an honor, and this is just the beginning. I am a local guy, willing to defend, and make this an awesome opportunity for others to have a pathway. I will give it my all, the question I have for you is will you be there to see and experience our journey? Go App FC!”

He will play a big part this season and the fans can expect to see an all-action defender that will give everything for the club.”
